Version 0.21 - 30. March 2012

    * Changed the name from 'Export to LaTeX' to 'Tomboy Exporter'
    * LaTeX header, updated a little bit, added a dependency needed for proper underline formatting
    * Added: support for more greek letters, should now all be parsed correctly
    * Added: support for more formatting styles; strikethrough, underline, monospace, small, large, huge (only one missing now is highlighted)
    * Added: options to skip hyperlinking & special icelandic language settings
    * Added: detects if the output file already exists and warns the user accordingly
    * Added: dialog to select a file for the output
    * Fixed: does no longer output the BOM mark at the beginning of files (interrupted LaTeX parsing)
    * Fixed: console output now goes through the logger
    * Fixed: "\begin{itemize}" should now appear in its own line in the output, not at the end of the previous line
    * Fixed: does no longer display the note name both as a latex section name and as part of the main text
    * Considerable code cleanup

	Known issues:

	    * Formatted hyperlinked text causes errors when parsing the outputted LaTeX code (e.g. "\hyperlink{\uline{monotonicity}{Monotonicity}}" should be "\uline{\hyperlink{monotonicity}{Monotonicity}}")
	    * Tries to work with text inside formulas, treat LaTeX commands as hyperlinks etc.
	    * May skip some notes within a notebook, probably if an error occurs -> improve error checking?
	    * The code is far from pretty, it does its job but there is great room for improvements
